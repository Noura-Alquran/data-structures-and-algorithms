# Code Challenge 11 :
## Implement queue from two stacks

## Challenge
* Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:
 1. enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
 2. dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
* The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency:

* Big O :
  - enqueue() >> O(1) .
  - dequeue >> O(n) .
