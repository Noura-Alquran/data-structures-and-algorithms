# Code Challenge 18 :
## Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

## Challenge
* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
   * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with **Fizz**
   * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with **Buzz**
   * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with **FizzBuzz**
   * If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
- Return a new tree.
