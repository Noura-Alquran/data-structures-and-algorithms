# Code Challenge 32 :
## Find common values in 2 binary trees.
## Challenge
* Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency:
