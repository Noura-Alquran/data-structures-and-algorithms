# Code Challenge 27 :
## Merge Sort
* Merge sort works by splitting the input list into two halves, repeating the process on those halves, and finally merging the two sorted halves together

## Challenge
* Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
* Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
* Present a complete set of working tests

## Approach & Efficiency:
### Whiteboard:
![image](../../assets/Merge_Sort.jpg)

### Efficiency (Big O) :
* Time complexity >>  O(n.logn) because the list is being split in log(n) calls and the merging process takes linear time in each call.
* Space complexity >> O(1)
